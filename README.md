# Social Networking System

This is a backend social networking system aiming for low latency and high throughput. It provides APIs for building friendships, posting messages and photos, news feeds, giving comments and likes, pushing notifications, etc. It adopts Redis, Memcached, denormalization, and HBase to reduce database queries and increase query efficiency. It uses Message Queue to deliver asynchoronized tasks and cut down response time. This project is expected to be completed by the end of July, 2022.
